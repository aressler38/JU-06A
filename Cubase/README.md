# How to Install the MIDI Device

* **The ju-06a-midi-inst.xml file has a FNPath object in it with a "path" string XML element that needs to be set to your installation of Cubase!** A first time import shouldn't need any adjustment, but if you edit this file by hand, then things could break if this is not set properly.
* In Cubase, go to Studio > More Options > MIDI Device Manager to import the XML file.

# Panels and Presets (optional)

After installing the device's XML, copy the presets and panels into the Cubase foler.
On Windows, it's here: `$HOME\AppData\Steinberg\Cubase {version}\`.
