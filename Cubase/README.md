# How To Install MIDI Device

* **The ju-06a-midi-inst.xml file has a FNPath object in it with a "path" string XML element that needs to be set to your installation of Cubase!**
* After you update the path in that file, in Cubase, go to Studio > More Options > MIDI Device Manager to import it.

# Panels and Presets

After installing the device's XML, copy the presets and panels into the Cubase foler.
On Windows, it's here: `$HOME\AppData\Steinberg\Cubase {version}\`.
